Javascript exercise made in Scrimba javascript free course.

Imagine you have a donuts shop and you have to wrap donuts orders but you always loses track on how many donuts you putted in each box. Don't be afraid, your problems have been solved with the donuts counter!

Of course that's just a fun and random idea I had to give a theme for the counter we created at this course.
